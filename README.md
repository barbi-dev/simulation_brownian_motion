# Brownian Motion — 2D Simulation

Interactive and visual simulation of 2D Brownian motion, inspired by
statistical physics and stochastic processes.

##  Description
This project simulates Brownian motion as a random walk generated by
normally distributed steps. The trajectory emerges from the accumulation
of random displacements, illustrating how structure arises from randomness.

## Concepts involved

- Brownian motion
- Random walks
- Stochastic processes
- Statistical physics

 ## Visual identity

All visuals follow the BarbiDev cyberpunk aesthetic.
